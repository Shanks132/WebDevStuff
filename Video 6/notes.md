Core Web Vitals

Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important in a webpage’s overall user experience. They show a URL’s performance grouped by status (Poor, Need Improvement, Good) metric. The performance output is generated from actual field user data. Core Web Vitals are made up of three specific page speed and user interaction measurements: largest contentful paint, first input delay, and cumulative layout shift.

In short, Core Web Vitals are a subset of factors that will be part of Google’s “page experience” score (basically, Google’s way of sizing up your page’s overall UX).




Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
LCP is how long it takes a page to load from the point of view of an actual user.

In other words: it’s the time from clicking on a link to seeing the majority of the content on-screen.

LCP is different from other pagespeed measurements. Many other page speed metrics (like TTFB and First Contextual Paint) don’t necessarily represent what it’s like for a user to open up a webpage.

On the other hand, LCP focuses on what really matters when it comes to page speed: being able to see and interact with your page.

You can check your LCP score using Google PageSpeed Insights or Website Checker.




First Input Delay (FID)
Next, let’s take a look at Google’s second Core Web Vital: First Input Delay.

So at this point, your page has achieved FCP. But the question is: can users interact with your page?

Well, that’s exactly what FID measures: the time it takes for a user to actually interact with your page.

Examples of interactions include:

Choosing an option from a menu
Clicking on a link in the site’s navigation
Entering your email into a field
Opening up “accordion text” on mobile devices
Google considers FID important because it takes into account how real-life users interact with websites.



Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
It is a measure how stable a page is as it loads (aka “visual stability”).

In other words: if elements on your page move around as the page loads, then you’ve got a high CLS. Which is bad.

Instead, you want your page elements to be fairly stable as it loads up. That way, users don’t have to re-learn where links, images and fields are located when the page is fully loaded. Or click on something by mistake.
